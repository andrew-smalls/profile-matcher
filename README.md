# profile-matcher
This is my solution to the "Profile Matcher" problem proposed by Gameloft Barcelona. Technologies used: IntelliJ 2023.2.5, Java 21, Spring Boot, H2 Database, Postman. 

The repository can be clonned locally. The entry point resides in ProfileMatcherApplication class, under **profile-matcher/src/main/java/com/andrei/profilematcher/**

All required tasks have been carried out successfully (in my opinion) :)

In order to test the program after it starts, I suggest using Postman or a standard browser and sending the following request: **localhost:4040/get_client_config/97983be2-98b7-11e7-90cf-082e5f28d836**

Lastly, I enjoyed working on this small project and can see myself trying to come with better solutions regarding matching profiles to game campaigns. Looking forward to hearing from you!
